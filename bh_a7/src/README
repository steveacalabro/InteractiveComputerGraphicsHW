Language: C++



This code loads a triangle mesh model from an smf file and view the model in 3 different projection modes (perspective, orthographic and parallel). Two point lights sources are placed in the scene, one is defined in model space and the other in view space. Both Gouraud and Phong shading models are implemented.


A rotating camera view of the model is displayed. The camera rotates on a cylinder around the model. Allow the user to interactively change the height, the orbit radius and speed of the camera. The camera rotates around and look at the smf model (i.e. your LookAt point stays constant). The light that defined in model space also rotates on a cylinder around the model. The user can change the orbit radius, light location along the cylinder and angle around the cylinder.

***************************** Instructions *********************************** 
1. Press 'W', 'S' for increasing and decreasing the camera's Y position
2. Press 'A', 'D' for increasing and decreasing the camera's rotation raidus
3. Press 'Q', 'E' to increasing and decreasing the camera's rotation speed
4. Press 'Z', 'X' to increasing and decreasing the light's rotation raidus
5. Press 'C', 'V' to increasing and decreasing the light's Y position
6. Press 'B', 'N' to increasing and decreasing the light's rotation angle
7. Press 'SPACE' to pause/resume animation
8. Use mouse right click to change camera's projection mode, material and shading model
9. Press 'ESC' to exit program
