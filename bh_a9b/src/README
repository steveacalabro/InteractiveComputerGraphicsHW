This code loads and displays three smooth-shaded triangle-mesh objects. A light source is attached to the camera. The user is able to change the view of the geometric objects by mouse left click.
When clicked the object's color should change. The scene can be viewed in 3 different projection modes (perspective, orthographic and parallel).


A rotating camera view of the model is displayed. The camera rotates on a cylinder around the model. Allow the user to interactively change the height, the orbit radius and speed of the camera. The camera rotates around and look at the objects.
