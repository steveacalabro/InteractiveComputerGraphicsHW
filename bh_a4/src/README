Language: C++


This code creates an OpenGL program that displays a colored cube. The user can transform the cube via key input. 

1. Enable the depth test to ensure proper display. 

2. A right click menu is created to defines the transformation to be modified. (SCALE, ROTATE, TRANSLATE). The transformations are applied in the order of scale, rotation, then translation.

3. Use 'A', 'D', 'W', 'S', 'Q', 'E' for increasing and decreasing the X,Y,Z components of the current transformation.

4. Use 'Z', 'X' for increasing and decreasing the delta added to the transformations.

5. Press 'R' to reset the transformations
