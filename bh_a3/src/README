Language: C++

This code uses double buffering to:
1. Create a main window with the "black & white" square
2. Place an ellipse in a SubWindow of the main window. Set the sub-window's display function to draw the background a different color.
3. Create a menu on the sub window only that allows the user to change the subwindow's background color.
4. Draw a circle and triangle, which have the same color, in a separate window entitled “window 2”. Allow the user to change the color of these objects by typing a key, 'r' - red, 'g' - green, 'b' - blue, 'y' - yellow, 'o' - orange, 'p' - purple, 'w' - white.
5. Animate the shapes using the idle function as follows:
6. Make the squares rotate counter clockwise.
7. Make the triangle rotate clockwise.
8. Make the circle increase in size and then decrease in size as though it was “breathing”.
9. Create a menu for the main window that is right-click activated with the following layout:
	Stop Animation
	Start Animation
	Square Colors ->
		 White
		 Red
		 Green
Where each button does the indicated action.
10. (Extra Credit) Alter the main window so that if a user clicks on it with the left click button, a new circle with a random color appears where s/he clicked.
